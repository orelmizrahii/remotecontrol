### Working

[media-control.py](./media-control.py) `Flask` app serves a remote UI in `/` with `/control` as the API endpoint for POST requests made by `index.js`

[index.js](./remote/static/js/index.js) sends POST requests to the API using fetch with the button id and mode.

[controller.py](./controller.py) presses the right key/key-combination to control the host device using `pynput` package.
